The binary Pwn_tools sends the player a series of questions in two formats:

Sorting Table: A list of integers to be sorted in descending order.

XOR Operation: A prompt asking to compute the XOR between two integers.

Our goal is to automate the interaction with this binary and solve these challenges programmatically using the pwntools library.

Go to solver.py

FLAG: Spark{Pwn_t00ls_y3_m34th3bh0m}
